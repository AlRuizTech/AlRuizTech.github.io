In my role as a Data Analyst at B+T Engineering, I implemented a 
streamlined tracking system using Excel, reducing processing time by 50%
and enhancing workflow efficiency. My proficiency in developing 
training modules with Word, Excel, and PowerPoint led to a remarkable 
33% reduction in onboarding time. 
At Arvest Bank, I excelled as a Help 
Desk Representative, consistently achieving top performer rankings and 
showcasing exceptional troubleshooting skills.
